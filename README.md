Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In Project Two, I wrote code to create each episode, run epoch loops, choose between random moves or the quality algorithm, track actions for the neural network, and handle win and loss states. The project already came with Keras, other necessary libraries, 
the neural network model, and controllers for default settings like model parameters and the number of episodes.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science: What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists develop solutions that are intelligent, efficient, and beneficial for users of computers. This course helped me learn more about AI and how it fits into computer science. Using AI can make programs easier to use and more automated.
These solutions matter because they affect both the creators and the people using the programs. I also learned about rules like the EU’s GDPR that protect people’s data when using AI.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems by asking how I can make my solution better, how it helps others, if there are better options, and if it is ethical. This helps me make sure my work is correct, useful, and safe.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a computer scientist, I must protect users’ data and interests. Rules like the GDPR show that data should only be used when needed, kept anonymous if possible, and secured from unauthorized access. Writing code that protects people is just as important as 
writing code that works.
